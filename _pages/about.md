Hello ! 

I'm a PhD Student located at the University of Mons (Belgium) in the ![InFluX lab](https://influxpascal.github.io/) InFluX lab (UMONS-BELGIUM) under the supervision of Pascal Damman. I'm currently working on the physics of dense granular flows through experiments, simulations and theory done in collaboration with Elie Raphael (Gulliver, ESPCI) and Thomas Salez (LOMA, University of Bordeaux).
